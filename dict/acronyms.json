With the rapid development and expansion of the wireless com\u0002munication networks, PIM is recognized as one of the most critical issues.\n\nEspecially in the base station, where several networks systems have to share the same infrastructure, a few transmitted signals are physically close to each other, even they could be sharing the same antenna. So it is highly possible that several transmitted signals hit a same nonlinear junction and generate PIM distortion, then the PIM distortion falls in some bands of the receivers nearby.\n\nEven more critically, since some technologies are developed with multi-carrier or multi-band, such as Carrier Aggregation and MIMO, the generated PIM could spread in a wide range of the spectrum and overlap with the receiver bands."

      "definition": "The need for very high data rates and capacities in the modern wireless communication systems requires wide band transmit signals in the base stations. This large bandwidth makes the design of the power amplifier(PA) challenging. The power amplifier is an essential part of any transmitter to convert the signal in to higher power and drive the antenna. For power amplifiers, there is a trade off between the bandwidth, linearity and energy consumption. Linearity here is a measure of the signal distortion due to non-linearities of the transistors which form the power amplifier. The need for energy efficiency in the base stations makes it necessary to find energy efficient linearization techniques. Transmission observation receivers(TOR) are often used for this purpose, where the transmitted signal is fed back to a linear TOR chain. The output from the TOR is then fed to a digital pre-distortion circuit (DPD) which is one of the advanced linearization techniques that compensates for nonlinear distortion in power amplifiers by creating a compensation signal that pre-distorts the input of the PA so that, the output appears non distorted and perfect. DPD allows PAs to be highly efficient without linearity degradation, which is nowadays one of the essential requirements in high-power wireless base stations."

The Ericsson UDC solution deliveries a state-of-the-art implementation of Data Layered Architecture (DLA) technology providing more efficiency to manage the data having the users and not individual types of accesses or services, into focus. This is what we at Ericsson call Customer-Centric Networks.\n\nThe UDC solution eliminates the complexity of managing subscription by consolidating subscriber information from the different network silos into one common repository, creating a Unified Profile. This allows for a simpler and more scalable network topology, more efficiency on managing the network database resources and it also gives more flexibility to introduce new services."

Here are some common RPO times for different types of data:\n\n1. Real-time: Some mission-critical systems, such as financial transactions or online transactions, may require a real-time RPO, meaning that any data loss is unacceptable. These systems often use synchronous replication to ensure that data is continuously mirrored to a secondary location.\n\n2. Near-zero RPO: For other critical systems, an RPO of a few seconds or less may be necessary to minimize data loss and ensure business continuity.\n\n3. Minutes to hours: Many organizations have RPO times ranging from a few minutes to a few hours for less critical systems and data. This allows for regular backups or replication to occur at intervals that are acceptable for the business.\n\n4. Daily or longer: For less critical data or systems, an RPO of a day or longer may be acceptable. This means that data is backed up on a daily basis or less frequently, depending on the specific requirements of the organization.\n\nIt's important for organizations to carefully assess their data protection needs and determine appropriate RPO times for different types of data and systems based on their criticality, cost of downtime, and regulatory obligations. Implementing the right data protection and disaster recovery strategies will help ensure that RPO objectives are met in the event of an outage or disaster.\n\nReference: Gerative AI from Ericsson"

In other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would equal one sample compared to the other sample.\n\nIn a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable's PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and its integral over the entire space is equal to 1."

The Kubernetes API server uses the CRD to create REST endpoints for managing these custom objects. In addition, the Kubernetes API server also handles the life cycle of resources defined in the CRD while the actual business logic for a custom resource is handled by a so-called Controller.\n\nRef: https://loft.sh/blog/kubernetes-crds-huge-pain-in-multi-tenant-clusters/"

How does the RIC work?\nThe RIC enables interoperability across different hardware (O-RU, servers) and software (O-DU/O-CU) components in an O-RAN architecture. It features a standardized interface – called the E2 – from the O-CU and O-DU to the RIC. It’s along that interface that the RIC receives measurements from the RAN about the performance of the network.\n\nIt then makes intelligent decisions to improve things like subscriber positioning, handover to a cell, and changing to different frequency. It adapts any variables in order to optimize the subscriber experience and network performance. To affect these improvements, intelligence is then sent back across the interface to the RAN. A measurement is then made to see if there’s been an improvement."

Users can send data through a subchannel by modulating it on a carrier wave at the subchannel's frequency. It is used in satellite communication systems and telephone trunklines.\n\nFDMA splits the total bandwidth into multiple channels. Each ground station on the earth is allocated a particular frequency group (or a range of frequencies). Within each group, the ground station can allocate different frequencies to individual channels, which are used by different stations connected to that ground station. Before the transmission begins, the transmitting ground station looks for an empty channel within the frequency range that is allocated to it and once it finds an empty channel, it allocates it to the particular transmitting station.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-division_multiple_access"

As with most telecommunication signaling methods, it uses routing information to direct the payload of voice or data to its destination. With CAS, this routing information is encoded and transmitted in the same channel as the payload itself. This information can be transmitted in the same band (in-band signaling) or a separate band (out-of-band signaling) to the payload. Call setup will be comparatively slower since signaling channels are shared thus congestion can be faced.\n\nCAS potentially results in lower available bandwidth for the payload. For example, in the PSTN the use of out-of-band signaling within a fixed bandwidth reduces a 64 kbit/s DS0 to 56 kbit/s. Because of this, and the inherent security benefits of separating the control lines from the payload, telephone systems introduced since the 1960s rely more on common-channel signaling (CCS).[1]\n\nThe most common implementation of CAS is robbed-bit signaling."

The PAT is usually generated automatically by the remote system — for example, as a string of 40 hexadecimal characters. Typically, permissions may also be adjusted for each PAT individually, allowing or restricting access to certain classes of data or functions on the remote system. These permissions can usually be adjusted only after authenticating with the password. This can be a useful form of delegation of authorization, for example, when creating programs that will access the remote system. The PAT will typically be stored in a location accessible to the program, and therefore not typically as secure as a password. If the program or PAT is compromised, the damage will be limited by the permissions available to that PAT, and the PAT itself can easily be revoked to prevent further exploitation.\n\nReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_access_token#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20personal%20access,instead%20of%20the%20usual%20password."

These are parameters that are derived, discovered, computed that are used by xNFs during run time AFTER the xNF becomes operational i.e. AFTER it has “booted up”, been installed or configured. For example, in 5G Network, 5G PNFs may need to adjust a tower electrical antenna tilt. These operational parameters are Exo-inventory information, meaning it is information that doesn’t belong in A&AI.

The standard is supported by many software products; you are less dependent on any particular vendor’s products.\n\nSimplicity\nThe principle behind BPMN is rather simple which is why you can start working with this notation very quickly.\n\nPower of expression\nIf necessary, you can describe precisely how a process functions with BPMN. However, this is more difficult than only roughly describing the process. This way of precise modeling is possible, but not mandatory.\n\nImplementation in IT\nBPMN has been primarily developed to support technical implementation of processes (“Process Automation”).

Some of these services depends on AFS. There is a good reason that many people are not aware of the AFS service.\n\nThe AFS file system provides a transparent mechanism to supply the application tree, environment files, ARC project environments and toolboxes to Ericsson's Linux/Unix services around the world.\n\nSource: https://wiki.lmera.ericsson.se/wiki/Ericsson_Service-Aware_Policy_Controller/tools/AFS\n\nAndrew File System (AFS) is a distributed file system with built-in replication capabilities that enable users to share files.\nIt also has a client-side caching feature for faster file loading times. Authentication and access rights are handled with Kerberos.\n\nThe AFS storage consists of several Volumes which are independent of each other. Volumes have a quota assigned to it to limit the amount of space consumed.\nAn AFS administrator could move that volume to another server and disk location without the need to notify users; indeed the operation occurs while files are in use.\n\nSource: https://eteamspace.internal.ericsson.com/display/GSSLUA/Linux+UNIX+Applications+AFS+Build+Toolbox+Administration+Guide"

For example, there are NIS maps that correspond to the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/hosts, and /etc/services files. The maps provide the centralized information to a given set of computers that make up a NIS domain.\n\nEach NIS map corresponds to a specific configuration file, such as the /etc/passwd or /etc/hosts file, and consists of a set of keys and values, and a version number for the data. When computers on the network require information stored in NIS maps, they send a NIS client request to the NIS listening port to query the NIS server for the information.\n\nWhen a computer needs the information stored in a NIS map, it runs the ypbind process to identify and connect to the NIS server best suited to respond to its requests. When the NIS server receives a request, it replies with the appropriate information from its set of NIS maps.\n\nReference: https://docs.centrify.com/Content/config-nis/NIS_Basics.htm"

DMZs are also known as perimeter networks or screened subnetworks.\n\nAny service provided to users on the public internet should be placed in the DMZ network. External-facing servers, resources and services are usually located there. Some of the most common of these services include web, email, domain name system, File Transfer Protocol and proxy servers.\n\nServers and resources in the DMZ are accessible from the internet, but the rest of the internal LAN remains unreachable. This approach provides an additional layer of security to the LAN as it restricts a hacker's ability to directly access internal servers and data from the internet.\n\nHackers and cybercriminals can reach the systems running services on DMZ servers. Those servers must be hardened to withstand constant attack.

The CIFS application uses the TCP/IP protocol and works best on Windows operating systems to share files between machines on a network. Initially, incorporated for file sharing, but now CIFS is exercised for network management and other network services. In this protocol, users or administrators can edit, read, write, or delete files on the remote server. The best part about CIFS is it follows client server methodology as per which you can communicate with any server set to get CIFS client requests.\n\nReference: https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/nfs-vs-cifs/"

More broadly, you want to know what is in your contract at any given moment: you want Availability.\n\nThe method also adds another part to consider (even if people stop at C, I, A): If your contract gets disclosed, destroyed, or maliciously modified, you may want a Proof that this happened, for insurance purposes, for example.\n\nThere you have it: the method is named upon its four main components: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, (sometimes Proof)\n\nReference: https://blog.sqreen.com/cybersecurity-risk-assessment-for-startup-cto/"

However, as each simulated radio requires a point to point connection to the DU, the maximum number of radios you can setup (at this time) is:\n\nDU6630/DU6648: 12 SRUs, as these DUs only have 12 RI-ports.\n\nEach simulated radio should be able to support 2 Sector carriers and 2 Cells.

The master device generates the clock signals, and the slave devices respond by transmitting data during the appropriate clock cycles. These clock signals are used to ensure that the data is transmitted accurately and efficiently between compatible devices. \n\nIn summary, SCLn pins are a key part of the I2C protocol used for inter-device communication, delivering synchronization signals that enable data to be transferred accurately.\n**This description was AI generated**\n\nReference: https://erilink.ericsson.se/eridoc/erl/objectId/09004cffc5d4817b?action=specific&format=undefined&option=download"

The approach has opened DR to organizations that wouldn't have been able to afford such a capability in the past.\n\nTypically, DRaaS requirements and expectations are documented in a service-level agreement (SLA), and the third-party vendor provides failover to a cloud computing environment, either through a contract or on a pay-per-use basis. In the event of an actual disaster, an off-site vendor is less likely than the enterprise itself to suffer the direct and immediate effects, which enables the provider to implement the customer's DR plan even in the event of the worst-case scenario -- a total or near-total shutdown of the affected enterprise.\n\nReference:\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchdisasterrecovery/definition/disaster-recovery-as-a-service-DRaaS"

VBS enforces restrictions to protect vital system and operating system resources, or to protect security assets such as authenticated user credentials.\n\nOne such example security solution is memory integrity, which protects and hardens Windows by running kernel mode code integrity within the isolated virtual environment of VBS. Kernel mode code integrity is the Windows process that checks all kernel mode drivers and binaries before they're started, and prevents unsigned or untrusted drivers or system files from being loaded into system memory. Memory integrity also restricts kernel memory allocations that could be used to compromise the system, ensuring that kernel memory pages are only made executable after passing code integrity checks inside the secure runtime environment, and executable pages themselves are never writable. That way, even if there are vulnerabilities like a buffer overflow that allow malware to attempt to modify memory, executable code pages cannot be modified, and modified memory cannot be made executable.\n\nReference:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs"

It enables you to combine internal storage drives on a cluster of physical servers (2 and up to 16) into a software-defined pool of storage. This storage pool has cache, tiers, resiliency, and erasure coding across columns—all configured and managed automatically.\n\nYou can scale out the storage capacity of your cluster by adding more drives or adding more servers in the cluster. Storage Spaces Direct automatically onboards the new drives and rebalances the storage pool. It also automatically uses the fastest storage media present to provide built-in and always-on cache.\n\nReference:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/concepts/storage-spaces-direct-overview"

GSLB provides multi-site resilience with seamless failover and failback in the event of a critical resource failure as well as offering optimised redirection of traffic to the closest physical service location. In the event of a service disruption, traffic is automatically redirected based on predefined policies to minimize impact and the need for manual intervention.\n\nClient traffic is sent to the location that will provide the very best application performance and client experience, tailored to the location of the client and the observed availability of each location. The client traffic redirection can be further refined using EDNS (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) to provide fine-grained control on which available locations a client is directed based on their source subnet.\n\nProviding these services locally is a cost-effective alternative to providing these services using in-house resources or contracting with expensive hosted Domain Name Service (DNS) services that don’t provide the flexibility and control that you require. Services like company email, remote desktop environments, and other managed resources where user experience, high availability, and disaster recovery are mission critical.\n\nReference:\nhttps://kemptechnologies.com/fr/global-server-load-balancing-gslb"

CHERI has been supported by the DARPA CRASH, MRC, and SSITH programs since 2010, as well as other DARPA research and transition funding. Since 2019, development of Arm's experimental CHERI-enabled Morello processor, SoC, and board has been supported by UKRI. We gratefully acknowledge DARPA, UKRI, and our other supporters including EPSRC, ERC, Google, and Arm.\n\nCHERI extends conventional hardware Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with new architectural features to enable fine-grained memory protection and highly scalable software compartmentalization. The CHERI memory-protection features allow historically memory-unsafe programming languages such as C and C++ to be adapted to provide strong, compatible, and efficient protection against many currently widely exploited vulnerabilities. The CHERI scalable compartmentalization features enable the fine-grained decomposition of operating-system (OS) and application code, to limit the effects of security vulnerabilities in ways that are not supported by current architectures.\n\nCHERI is a hybrid capability architecture in that it is able to blend architectural capabilities with conventional MMU-based architectures and microarchitectures, and with conventional software stacks based on virtual memory and C/C++. This approach allows incremental deployment within existing software ecosystems, which we have demonstrated through extensive hardware and software prototyping.\n\nReference:\nhttps://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/"
