create a test dict for when it is full (fill with ericsson)
Make main dict tree to store multiple def per acro (done)
figure out how u want the search up to look (done ish)
get lookup and defining working with shortcut (done on main window)

09/01
add styling (bold expanded etc, use richtext mark down thing in fyne)
current look up is ugly, I also want to be able to hit Enter to add not have to click the damn add button

FUCKKKKKKK this popup thing seems to be difficult, since u can move a window and popups and popup menus are bound to a window, maybe I can just create windows and do window.Show() but I also have to figure out how to move them fuck. ok well seems

I also have an issue with the double window opening to define. I think i can just add a sleep after one hit to prevent double dips

09/02
get popup window above mouse position to lookup and define (https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/7d813563712924b381ced18c04869c059e2cb4c6/internal/driver/glfw/window_desktop.go), asked in discord how i can get it right above, idk just leave it for now, it shows up in the top left corner but at least its on the right monitor

09/03
everything except the fucking copy selection issue is done, tmrw get this done + package up the app


Rolling to do:
- add styling (bold expanded etc, use richtext mark down thing in fyne)
- fix fucking debounce issue
- make popup show up above mouse position
