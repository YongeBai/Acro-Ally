add styling (bold expanded etc)
current look up is ugly, I also want to be able to hit Enter to add not have to click the damn add button

FUCKKKKKKK this popup thing seems to be difficult, since u can move a window and popups and popup menus are bound to a window, maybe I can just create windows and do window.Show() but I also have to figure out how to move them fuck. ok well seems

I also have an issue with the double window opening to define. I think i can just add a sleep after one hit to prevent double dips
